# Actions Bot
A small Discord Bot made for Dr1fterX's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/URH5E34FZf) to add silly Slash Commands.

---
## Who is Dr1fterX?

> Dr1fterX is a small-ish Live Streamer on Twitch, and used to create content for the Black Plasma Gaming channel on YouTube before that YT Channel was archived in early 2020.
> You can find his Twitch Channel over at [twitch.tv/Dr1fterX](https://twitch.tv/Dr1fterX)

## What kind of Slash Commands are there?

> Mainly ones like /hug, /bonk, /headpat, etc. You know, roleplay-style.


## How many Slash Commands are there/will there be?

> For now I am limiting myself to a maximum of 10.
> Even though Discord's API supports up to 50 Guild Slash Commands per Bot, I am using this lower limit to prevent flooding the Slash Command Interface/GUI :)


## Can I add this Bot to my own Server?

> **No.**
> 
> This Bot is only made for use on Dr1fterX's Discord Server. Go search on [top.gg](https://top.gg) or ask on [r/discord_bots](https://www.reddit.com/r/Discord_Bots/) if you want your own Bot like this.
